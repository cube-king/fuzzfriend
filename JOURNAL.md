Here begins the journey! I've put in around 3 hours so far into learning the ABSOLUTE basics of circuits (e.g. diodes, resistance, current, voltage, etc etc) and I think I'm around ready to begin the actual process of designing and making a pedal!

I've researched how fuzz pedals work precisely, and here's a quick provisional summary:

- I've found so far they use *transistors* to amplify the input signal (giving it a somewhat "squashed" or compressed / distorted tone) 
- As well, they use *diodes* to clip the input, giving it a "fuzzy" sound! 

There are, of course, other components suited for directing and controlling the current - but those will be detailed later. The end result of these transformations is a more square-wave-esque output signal! 
This was found through a variety of websites, including a "7 minute fuzz" reference guide. 
I'm ending this journal entry for now, as I'm quite tired, and will provide better quality journal entries later on / in the morning.

Total hours spent: 3.5

Note: I've found a similar fuzz pedal lying around as of ~10:42 which I plan to base my ideas around and iterate on! Will detail more tomorrow

OKAY, sorry about that - had to focus primarily on a different project and schoolwork for a while, but I'll resume where I left off. Today and tomorrow, I'll be taking a look at the "original fuzz pedal" in order to make a similar functional pedal!

The fuzz pedal I currently have on hand is one of the first ever to be produced - it uses "PNP' (positive negative positive) transistors, which are incompatible with a traditional "line of signal" and even most amps. PNP requires a negative voltage to operate, while NPN requires a positive voltage to operate, causing extreme incompatibility with modern devices. However, the polarity of a schematic can be reversed fairly easily to be compatible with modern NPN transistors etc (journal is WIP)
