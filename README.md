A demonstrative fuzz pedal to learn the absolute basics of electronics and circuits!
In order to learn about - and then test my knowledge on - circuits and electronics, I'm creating a fuzz pedal! Much research and thought will be put into this, despite it being rather simplistic and rudimentary. 
This project will be my introduction into the hardware world - enjoy!
